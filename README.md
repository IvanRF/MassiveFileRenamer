==================

This software will allow you to easily rename multiple files. It's very fast and simple!

For advanced users and developers, it is possible to use **regular expressions**.

Available for **Windows** and **Linux**. Other OS were not tested yet....

Requirements: JRE 6 or higher.

## Download ##
You can [download](MassiveFileRenamer.zip?raw=true) the zip file containing only the required files to run the application.

## Contributions ##
You can contribuite with translations :)<br/>
The property files are located in [src/com/ivanrf/renamer/resources](src/com/ivanrf/renamer/resources). Use [Labels.properties](src/com/ivanrf/renamer/resources/Labels.properties) as reference.

Also, it would be nice if someone could test it under any OS other than Windows or Linux (Ubuntu) and tell me if it works as expected :)
